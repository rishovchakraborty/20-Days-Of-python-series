# Why does Python not support method overloading?
# in other lang like cpp/java
# add(int a, int b)
# add(int a, int b, int c)


# Python is:
# Dynamically typed
# Interpreted
# Late-binding

# Python not support constructor overloading as only one can exist



# What is Dynamic Typing in Python?

# Dynamic typing means:
# Type checking happens at runtime, not compile time.


# Monkey patching means:

# Modifying or extending code at runtime.
import math

math.pi = 3   # changing existing behavior
print(math.pi)
